Functional AI for solving the old mobile game 2048. 

# Run the script
On linux, and after installing the g++ cpp compiler run the two following commands in the terminal

  >>> g++ -o main main.cpp
  >>> ./main

# Max score
with this naive algorithm the AI can reach up to 80K in score
however in the second version, an optimization was added that increased maximum score all the way to 130k
